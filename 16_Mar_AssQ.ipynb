        "**Regularization in Machine Learning:**\n",
        "\n",
        "**Definition:**\n",
        "Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the model's cost function. The penalty discourages overly complex models, promoting simpler models that generalize better to new, unseen data.\n",
        "\n",
        "**Purpose:**\n",
        "The primary purpose of regularization is to find a balance between fitting the training data well (low bias) and avoiding fitting noise or fluctuations in the data (high variance).\n",
        "\n",
        "**Common Regularization Techniques:**\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **L1 Regularization (Lasso):**\n",
        "   - **Penalty Term:** Absolute values of the model parameters.\n",
        "   - **Effect:** Encourages sparsity by driving some parameters to exactly zero.\n",
        "   - **Use Case:** Feature selection, as L1 regularization can set some feature weights to zero.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **L2 Regularization (Ridge):**\n",
        "   - **Penalty Term:** Squared values of the model parameters.\n",
        "   - **Effect:** Discourages overly large weights, leading to a more evenly distributed impact of features.\n",
        "   - **Use Case:** Preventing multicollinearity and reducing the impact of outliers.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Elastic Net:**\n",
        "   - **Combination of L1 and L2 Regularization.**\n",
        "   - **Penalty Term:** Linear combination of the L1 and L2 penalty terms.\n",
        "   - **Effect:** Provides a compromise between L1 and L2 regularization, balancing sparsity and parameter shrinkage.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Dropout (Neural Networks):**\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Randomly \"drops out\" a fraction of neurons during training.\n",
        "   - **Effect:** Prevents reliance on specific neurons, leading to a more robust and generalized model.\n",
        "   - **Use Case:** Commonly used in neural networks.\n",
        "\n",
        "5. **Early Stopping:**\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Monitor the model's performance on a validation set during training and stop when performance plateaus or degrades.\n",
        "   - **Effect:** Prevents the model from overfitting to the training data by halting training at an optimal point.\n",
        "   - **Use Case:** Particularly useful in iterative optimization algorithms.\n",
        "\n",
        "6. **Weight Decay:**\n",
        "   - **Implementation:** Adds a term to the loss function proportional to the sum of the squared weights.\n",
        "   - **Effect:** Discourages large weight values and helps prevent overfitting.\n",
        "   - **Use Case:** Commonly used in linear regression and neural networks.\n",

        "**How Regularization Works:**\n",
        "\n",
        "- **Penalty Term:** Regularization adds a penalty term to the cost function that is a function of the model parameters.\n",
        "- **Minimizing Complexity:** The penalty term discourages overly complex models by penalizing large parameter values.\n",
